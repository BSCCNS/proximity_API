    Perform asynchronous setup for processing a city model.

    This function orchestrates the setup of a city's model by:
    - Generating a unique task identifier.
    - Creating necessary folder structures inside (`data/cities`)
    - Spawning an asynchronous task that sequentially runs:
        - Serves a map in geojson format containing the proximity time for the given city.
        - Computes proximity time for the different types of pedestrians (residents, tourists, workers/students, leisure, access to hospitality, access to public transport)
    - Logging the start, progress, and completion (or cancellation) of the task.
    - Returning a dictionary containing the unique task identifier.

    ### Returns:
    - `dict`: A dictionary with the key `'task_id'` mapped to the unique identifier of the asynchronous task.

    ### Raises:
    - `Exception`: Propagates any exceptions, including task cancellations, encountered during the asynchronous
      operations for network or POI preparations.
